   <p> Today I learned how to make a turtle draw a shape in python. 
    I was slightly vexed, because I didn't figure out that I needed to specify 
    turning the input into an integer. Other than that, it went ok. </p>

   <p> A list is a collection of information / data in python that one call can call upon and utilize in various ways. They are 
    useful for storing information and names and strings and integers. 
    Chloe and I worked best together because she and I were building off each other's ideas. </p>

 <h2> July 5th </h2>
 <p> My idea of robotics generally stayed the same. I am a bit nervous about a completely roboticized world. Working in a group was
  fine but I was definitely the most talkative. (lol) </p>

 <h2> July 6th </h2>
 <p> I really enjoyed working with LED's. Our psuedo-code translated perfectly into actual code when we were using Arduino. Our pattern 
  was pretty cute, too! ^_^ </p>

  <h2> July 10th </h2>
  <p> I learned about how the circuits read code, and how it's not always simultaneous. I liked when the robot moved back and forth
   during "du nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh." Veloso would need servo outputs. </p>
