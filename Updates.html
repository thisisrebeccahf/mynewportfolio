   <p> Today I learned how to make a turtle draw a shape in python. 
    I was slightly vexed, because I didn't figure out that I needed to specify

   <p> A list is a collection of information / data in python that one call can call upon and utilize in various ways. They are 
    useful for storing information and names and strings and integers. 
    Chloe and I worked best together because she and I were building off each other's ideas. </p>

 <p> I really enjoyed working with LED's. Our psuedo-code translated perfectly into actual code when we were using Arduino. Our pattern 
  was pretty cute, too! ^_^ </p>
